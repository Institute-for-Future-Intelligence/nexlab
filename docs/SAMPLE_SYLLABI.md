## üéØ **Expected Parsing Results**

### **BIOL 301 Sample**
When imported, should generate:
- **Course Number**: `BIOL 301`
- **Course Title**: `Advanced Molecular Biology and Biotechnology`
- **Generated Materials**: 7 materials (1 overview + 6 weekly)
- **Objectives**: 6 learning objectives extracted
- **Schedule**: 15 weeks of content

### **CS 350 Sample**
When imported, should generate:
- **Course Number**: `CS 350`
- **Course Title**: `Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning`
- **Generated Materials**: 7 materials (1 overview + 6 weekly)
- **Objectives**: 7 learning objectives extracted
- **Schedule**: 16 weeks of content

## üîß **File Format Testing**

### **Supported Formats**
- ‚úÖ **Plain Text (.txt)** - Direct text processing
- ‚úÖ **PDF (.pdf)** - Text extraction using PDF.js
- ‚úÖ **Word Document (.docx)** - Text extraction using Mammoth

### **Testing Different Formats**
1. **Create PDF versions**: Save TXT files as PDF using any word processor
2. **Create DOCX versions**: Copy content into Microsoft Word and save as .docx
3. **Test extraction**: Upload each format and verify identical parsing results

## üìù **Creating Additional Samples**

### **Template Structure**
For consistent parsing, include these elements:

```
[COURSE NUMBER]: [COURSE TITLE]

Course Title: [Full Title]  
Course Number: [Number]
Instructor: [Name]
Institution: [Institution Name]

Course Description:
[2-3 paragraph description]

Learning Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
...

Course Schedule:

Week 1: [Topic]
[Description of week 1 content]

Week 2: [Topic]  
[Description of week 2 content]
...

Prerequisites: [List]
Required Textbook: [Book info]
Grading Policy: [Breakdown]
Contact Information: [Details]
```

### **Parser-Friendly Patterns**
- **Course numbers**: Use format like "CS 350", "BIOL 301", "MATH 101"
- **Objectives**: Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) or bullet points (-, ‚Ä¢)
- **Weekly content**: Start with "Week N:" followed by topic and description
- **Clear headers**: Use consistent labels like "Course Description:", "Learning Objectives:"

## üß™ **Testing Workflow**

1. **Upload Sample**: Use course creation form with "Import from Syllabus"
2. **Verify Extraction**: Check course info preview for accuracy
3. **Review Materials**: Confirm auto-generated materials match expectations
4. **Submit Request**: Test complete workflow including admin approval
5. **Check Results**: Verify materials appear in course after approval

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### **Parsing Accuracy**
- Course number and title extracted correctly
- Description captures main content  
- Objectives properly identified and formatted
- Weekly schedule generates appropriate materials

### **Material Generation**
- Overview material with course info and objectives
