1. Checks URL parameters for material ID
2. Queries Firestore for associated chatbot
3. Falls back to default chatbot ID

## 📊 Data Structure

### Quiz Session (Firestore: `quizSessions`)
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  quizId: string;
  chatbotId: string;
  userId: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  startedAt: string;
  submittedAt?: string;
  completed: boolean;
  answers: Record<string, string>;
  summary?: QuizSummary;
}
```

### Quiz Statistics (Zustand Store)
```typescript
{
  totalQuizzes: number;
  completedQuizzes: number;
  averageScore: number;
  difficultyBreakdown: Record<QuizDifficulty, number>;
  lastQuizDate?: string;
}
```
