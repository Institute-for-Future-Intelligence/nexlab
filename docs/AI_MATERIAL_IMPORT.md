## 🛠️ Critical Fixes & Improvements (2024)

### Image Processing Fixes
Three major issues were resolved to ensure complete PowerPoint import functionality:

#### 1. **Image Preview Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Images weren't displaying in preview mode during AI processing
- AI was generating invalid placeholder URLs like `placeholder_image_1.png`
- Browser showed 404 errors for non-existent image files

**Solution**: 
- Updated AI prompt to use empty URLs instead of placeholder filenames
- Enhanced `convertToMaterialFormat` to use extracted PowerPoint image blobs
- Added blob URL creation and tracking for proper preview display
- Implemented fallback to SVG data URI placeholders when no blob available

#### 2. **Duplicate Images Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple images per slide showed as duplicates instead of unique images
- Previous logic only stored first image per slide number
- All AI-generated image references for same slide got same blob URL

**Solution**:
- Changed mapping from `Map<slideNumber, ImageReference>` to `Map<slideNumber, ImageReference[]>`
- Implemented intelligent image matching strategies:
  1. Match by description/title similarity
  2. Use first unused image from slide
  3. Cycle through images if all used (better than duplicates)
- Added image usage tracking to prevent duplicates

#### 3. **Save/Upload Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Images weren't uploading to Firebase Storage when saving AI-imported materials
- Condition `isAIImported && !materialId` was failing because `materialId` was already set
- Images remained as blob URLs instead of getting Firebase Storage URLs

**Solution**:
- Updated condition to `isAIImported && hasUnuploadedImages`
- `hasUnuploadedImages` checks for blob URLs to determine upload need
- Added comprehensive blob URL detection across all sections and subsections
- Proper Firebase Storage upload with progress tracking

### Production Validation
**Browser Console Success Pattern**:
```
✅ Image extraction: 14 images extracted successfully
✅ Preview generation: All images display with blob URLs
✅ Save process: hasUnuploadedImages: true detected
✅ Firebase upload: 14 successful, 0 failed out of 14 total
✅ Final URLs: All images have permanent Firebase Storage URLs
```

### Test Coverage
- **8 focused integration tests** validate all fixes
- **100% test pass rate** for core functionality
- **Regression protection** for image handling workflow
