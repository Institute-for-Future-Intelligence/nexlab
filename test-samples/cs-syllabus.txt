Week 15: Final Project Presentations
Student presentations of their final AI/ML projects. Peer evaluation and discussion of project outcomes and lessons learned.

Week 16: Final Examinations
Comprehensive final examination covering all course material with emphasis on machine learning concepts and applications.

Grading Policy:
- Programming Assignments (40%)
- Midterm Examination (20%)
- Final Examination (25%)
- Final Project (10%)
- Class Participation and Quizzes (5%)

Programming Assignments:
Students will complete 6 programming assignments using Python and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Assignments focus on implementing AI algorithms and applying them to real datasets.

Final Project:
Students will work individually or in pairs to develop an AI application addressing a real-world problem. Projects must demonstrate the application of course concepts and include a comprehensive report and presentation.

Attendance Policy:
Regular attendance is expected. More than 3 unexcused absences may result in a reduction of the final grade.

Late Work Policy:
Programming assignments may be submitted up to 3 days late with a 10% penalty per day. No late submissions accepted for examinations without prior arrangement.

Academic Integrity:
All work must be original. Collaboration on assignments is encouraged for learning but final submissions must be individual work. Plagiarism will result in course failure.

Software Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
